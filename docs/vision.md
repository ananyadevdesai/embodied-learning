# Project Vision

## The Problem

Most machine learning research happens in simulation or with expensive, proprietary hardware. Real-world embodied learning—where agents learn through physical interaction with their environment—remains underexplored, especially at low cost.

## The Goal

Create an open, accessible dataset of real-world embodied learning experiments that:
- Uses low-cost, open hardware
- Documents both successes and failures
- Enables reproducible research
- Encourages diverse contributions

## Why This Matters

1. **Accessibility**: Low-cost hardware makes embodied learning research accessible to more people
2. **Realism**: Real-world data captures noise, failures, and edge cases that simulation misses
3. **Transparency**: Open data and schemas enable reproducible research
4. **Community**: Shared experiments accelerate learning and innovation

## What Success Looks Like

- Hundreds of documented experiments
- Diverse hardware platforms and tasks
- Active community of builders, developers, and researchers
- Published insights and analyses
- Open-source tools and firmware

## Principles

1. **Open by default**: Code, data, and documentation are open
2. **Real-world only**: No simulation-only experiments
3. **Failure is data**: Document what doesn't work
4. **Low barrier to entry**: 30-minute contribution path
5. **No lock-in**: Standard formats, open hardware

## Long-term Vision

This project could become:
- A standard dataset for embodied learning research
- A platform for collaborative hardware development
- A resource for teaching embodied AI
- A foundation for future research

But we start small: one experiment at a time.
