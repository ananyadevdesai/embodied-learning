# ESP32 Firmware

Firmware templates and examples for ESP32-based embodied learning systems.

## Getting Started

1. Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) or Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
2. Clone this repository
3. Copy a template to your project
4. Adapt for your hardware configuration

## Templates (To Be Added)

- Basic sensor reading (IMU, encoders)
- Motor control
- Data logging to SD card or WiFi
- Real-time control loops

## Hardware Compatibility

- ESP32 DevKit
- ESP32-CAM
- ESP32 with custom shields

## Contributing

Firmware contributions should:
- Include hardware wiring diagrams
- Document pin configurations
- Provide example data outputs
- Follow coding standards (see main CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Example Platforms

- Balance bots
- Mobile robots
- Manipulators
- Sensor arrays
